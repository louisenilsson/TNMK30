## PROJECT TASK

The project task was to design and implement a web-based interface to search for information in an existing database. The website must be complete with navigation, overview, search and structured presentation of large amounts of data. The database that we suggest you use is given and suggestions for possible information follow. Own ideas can also be discussed if there is special interest.
